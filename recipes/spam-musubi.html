  <h2>What is Tamago Sando?</h2>
  <p>Tamago (たまご) means eggs and sando is short for san-doh- itchi (サンドイッチ)—sandwich in Japanese. It is a modest, low-maintenance, convenience store sort of food. In comparison with American-style egg sandwiches, Japanese egg sandwich is a lot simpler. Usually just mashed boiled eggs between the bread. There are no spices, lettuce, or anything extra. It’s as pure as an egg salad sandwich can get.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups of rice (I prefer sushi rice for softness)</li>

  <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Furikake to taste (to mix into the cooked rice)</li>
    <li>Kewpie Mayonnaise (to use between egg and rice)</li>
    <li>French Omelette (to layer between spam and rice)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  *Note: If spam is too salty, soak cut spam in water for 20-30 minutes, changing water periodically, or just use alot more rice in the musubi.
