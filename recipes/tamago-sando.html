  <h2>What is Tamago Sando?</h2>
  <p>Tamago (たまご) means eggs and sando is short for san-doh- itchi (サンドイッチ)—sandwich in Japanese. It is a modest, low-maintenance, convenience store sort of food. In comparison with American-style egg sandwiches, Japanese egg sandwich is a lot simpler. Usually just mashed boiled eggs between the bread. There are no spices, lettuce, or anything extra. It’s as pure as an egg salad sandwich can get.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 slices of Japanese milk bread (or just plain ol white bread if unavailable)</li>
    <li> 3 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Japanese Mayonnaise (Kewpie Brand or any other)</li>
    <li>2 tsp milk</li>
  </ul>
